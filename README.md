- Hi, I’m @mwhite.  I'm an entrepreneurial software engineer.
- I co-founded [@getchabooks](http://github.com/getchabooks).  
- You may be interested in some libraries I've released or am working on:
    - [@mwhite/react-jsonapi](http://github.com/mwhite/react-jsonapi) - JSON API data loading for React
    - [@mwhite/JSONAlchemy](http://github.com/mwhite/JSONAlchemy) - SQL views of data stored in a Postgres JSON column
